# Lord of the Rings Chatbot

**This project is a simple chat bot that answers questions related to Lord of the rings.** I made this project to get some experience with adding the ability for the chatbots to call functions. The chatbot can call 2 different functions:

1. It can generate an image of a Lord of the rings character if you provide it with a name and then ask it to generate an image.
2. The other functionality is that it can access a genealogy function that will provide information related to the genealogies of most major characters in Lord of the rings.
