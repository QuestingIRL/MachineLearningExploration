This project is a simple chat bot that answers questions related to Lord of the rings. I made this project to get some experience with adding the ability for the chatbots to call functions. The chatbot can call 2 different functions. It can generate an image of a Lord of the rings character if you provide it with a name and then ask it to generate an image. The other functionality is that it can access a genealogy function that will provide 4o with information related to the genealogy's of most major characters in Lord of the rings.
